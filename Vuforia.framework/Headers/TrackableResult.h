     * Get the pose of the Trackable at the moment in time when this

     * The pose represents a transform from a target coordinate system (i.e.
     * the coordinate system of the Trackable) to the base coordinate system as
     * returned by getCoordinateSystem() (i.e. either camera-space or world-space,
     * depending on how %Vuforia has been configured).
     *
     * In other words, if this TrackableResult comes from an ObjectTracker, and
     * you render 3D geometry using
     *
     * - the pose matrix as the geometry's model-view matrix, and
     * - a projection matrix obtained from a RenderingPrimitives instance using
     *   the coordinate system returned by getCoordinateSystem(),
     *
     * then
     *
     * - (0,0,0) in your 3D geometry's local coordinate space will correspond to
     *   (0,0,0) in the Trackable's coordinate space, and
     * - your 3D geometry will rotate in the view to match the rotation of the
     *   Trackable.
     *
     * The result of this is that your application's view will contain geometry
     * that appears to be at the same place in the view as the Trackable. (Note
     * that depending on the type of Tracker there may be some drift under certain
     * conditions.)
     *
     * \note When the Trackable's STATUS (as returned by getStatus()) is NO_POSE,
     * this method will return the identity matrix.
     *
     * \returns A 3x4 row-major matrix representing the observed pose of the
     * Trackable, or the identity matrix if the Trackable's STATUS is NO_POSE.
     * (When using OpenGL, use Tool::convertPose2GLMatrix to convert to an
     * OpenGL-compatible matrix).
