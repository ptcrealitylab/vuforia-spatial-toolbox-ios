/// A type of ObjectTarget that represents an object constructed from multiple component Trackables.
/**
 * A MultiTarget is useful when you want to construct a Trackable using multiple
 * component Trackables arranged in a fixed spatial relationship to each other.
 *
 * To build a MultiTarget, you typically initialize and load a DataSet containing
 * the Trackables you want to combine (usually ImageTargets), then call
 * DataSet::createMultiTarget() to get a new MultiTarget object. Loop through
 * the Trackables using DataSet::getTrackable() and add them to the new MultiTarget
 * using addPart(), calling setPartOffset() to define the offset (position and
 * rotation) for each added Trackable.
 *
 * For example, suppose you want to be able to recognise and track a cereal box.
 * You also want to be able to initialize the tracking from both sides of the
 * box - it shouldn't matter if the front or the back of the box is facing the
 * user, your application should be able to recognise and track both sides.
 *
 * You would need to start by building two ImageTargets, one to track the front
 * side of the box, and another to track the back side. Normally, you would need
 * to track both of the ImageTargets separately in your application. But if you
 * build a MultiTarget and use addPart() and setPartOffset() to define a spatial
 * relationship between the two targets that matches the spatial relationship of
 * the front and back sides of your real-world cereal box, %Vuforia takes care
 * of tracking both of the ImageTargets as one, and returns
 * <span>TrackableResult</span>s as though you had just a single Trackable.
 *
 * \note
 * It is not possible to modify a MultiTarget while its DataSet is active.
 * See the DataSet class for more information.
 *
