/**
 * A %DataSet stores data for one or more ObjectTarget-derived Trackables (for a
 * full list of applicable types, refer to the inheritance tree diagram
 * for ObjectTarget).
 *
 * Typically, you obtain an empty %DataSet instance from ObjectTracker::createDataSet().
 * Populate the returned %DataSet either using load() with data prepared offline
 * (pairs of .xml and .dat files), or using createTrackable() with data provided
 * at runtime (for example from a camera frame). Once populated, activate the
 * %DataSet using ObjectTracker::activateDataSet().
 *
 * \anchor DataSetActive
 * It is not possible to modify a %DataSet, nor any of the <span>Trackable</span>s
 * which rely on it, while the %DataSet is active.
 *
 * To modify an active %DataSet (e.g. via calls to load(), createTrackable(),
 * destroy()) or to make changes to a Trackable which uses it, you need to do
 * the following:
 * -# Call ObjectTracker::deactivateDataSet() to deactivate the %DataSet.
 * -# Make the desired changes to the %DataSet and/or any of its Trackables.
 * -# Call ObjectTracker::activateDataSet() to activate the %DataSet, which will
 * resume tracking with the new data.
 *
 * To destroy the %DataSet once it is no longer needed, call ObjectTracker::deactivateDataSet()
 * followed by ObjectTracker::destroyDataSet().
