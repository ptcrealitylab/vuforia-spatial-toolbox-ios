/**
 * You can use the information collected to make hit tests into the user's environment.
 *
 * The functionality and operation of SmartTerrain is affected by the active Fusion
 * provider (see Vuforia::getActiveFusionProvider()).
 *
 *   - SmartTerrain cannot be used with FUSION_PROVIDER_VUFORIA_VISION_ONLY, and
 *     will therefore fail to start.
 *
 *   - When using FUSION_PROVIDER_VUFORIA_SENSOR_FUSION, calls to hitTest() will
 *     generate results immediately after the SmartTerrain tracker and the camera
 *     have been started. However, the returned results may not accurately reflect
 *     the position of the hit point(s) until the PositionalDeviceTracker has been
 *     allowed enough time to initialize after calling
 *     PositionalDeviceTracker::createAnchor(const char*, const HitTestResult&).
 *     This typically takes a few seconds, depending on how the user moves
 *     their device. During this time the positions of any created Anchors may
 *     fluctuate. See PositionalDeviceTracker for more details.
 *
 *   - When using FUSION_PROVIDER_PLATFORM_SENSOR_FUSION, no hit test results will
 *     be returned until the underlying platform systems have initialized. This
 *     typically takes a few seconds, depending on how the user moves their device.
 *
 * For cross-platform consistency, you should assume that
 *
 *   - calls to hitTest() might not yield any results for a few seconds, and
 *
 *   - the reported position of an Anchor created from early hit test results
 *     may fluctuate for a few seconds as %Vuforia learns more about the environment.

     * This function will perform a hit test between a ray and a plane in the
     * world as understood by the SmartTerrain. The ray is cast from the given
     * point on the device's screen (typically from a user tapping the screen).
     * An approximate deviceHeight above an assumed infinite ground plane may be
     * used to provide an estimated ground plane intersection when the available
     * data on the environment is limited. A single hit test may generate multiple
     * results if the ray intersects more than one detected plane.
     *
     * Specific behaviour of the hit test depends on the active Fusion provider
     * (see Vuforia::getActiveFusionProvider())).
     *
     * - When using FUSION_PROVIDER_VUFORIA_SENSOR_FUSION, \p deviceHeight specifies
     * the device's approximate height above an assumed infinite ground plane
     * on which the hit test result may lie; however it will be ignored if an
     * existing (finite, localized) plane from a previous hit test is found
     * along or near to the ray path.
     *
     * - When using FUSION_PROVIDER_PLATFORM_SENSOR_FUSION, \p deviceHeight is
     * ignored and %Vuforia will only return results when the hit test ray
     * intersects actual detected planes in the user's environment.
     *
     * After calling hitTest(), use getHitTestResultCount() and getHitTestResult()
     * to access the internal list of <span>HitTestResult</span>s. Any subsequent
     * calls to hitTest() will destroy and rebuild this list.
     *
     * \note A hit test is bound to a specific State. If you want the results
     * to correspond to the current video frame, be sure to use the same State
     * as you use for rendering the frame.
     *
     * \param state The state to use for doing the hit test.
     * \param point Point in the normalized coordinate space of the camera image
     * retrieved from the State (top left (0,0), bottom right (1,1)) to use as
     * the origin of the ray.
     * \param deviceHeight Height of the device center above ground plane in meters.
     * May be ignored.
     * \param hint A hint about the orientation of the plane in the scene. May be
     * ignored.
