 * %Vuforia Fusion is a feature, introduced with %Vuforia 7, that is designed
 * to provide the best possible AR experience on a wide range of devices. Fusion
 * solves the problem of fragmentation in AR-enabling technologies, including
 * cameras, sensors, chipsets, and software frameworks such as ARKit, ARCore and
 * Windows Holographic. It fuses the capabilities of the underlying device with
 * %Vuforia features, allowing developers to rely on a single %Vuforia API for
 * an optimal AR experience across multiple devices and platforms.
 *
 * This method provides advanced developers with a way to control which
 * technologies Fusion will use.
 *
 * Before you pass anything other than FUSION_PROVIDER_ALL, you should have a
 * solid understanding of
 *   - the functionality offered by the underlying platforms,
 *   - the technology involved in enabling AR, and
 *   - the robustness of the various options.
 *
 * If you restrict Fusion to FUSION_PROVIDER_VUFORIA_VISION_ONLY, Ground Plane will cease
 * to work and ModelTargets will operate in a less robust manner.
 *
 * Not all Fusion providers are available on all platforms. If none of the
 * allowed Fusion providers are available, FUSION_PROVIDER_VUFORIA_VISION_ONLY will be
 * used as a fallback (even if it is not passed to setAllowedFusionProviders()).
 * Use getActiveFusionProvider() (after Vuforia::init() has succeeded) to find
 * out which Fusion provider is actually in use.
 *
 * \note This function must be called before Vuforia::init() if the provider to
 * be changed is FUSION_PROVIDER_PLATFORM_SENSOR_FUSION. FUSION_PROVIDER_VUFORIA_SENSOR_FUSION
 * can be modified after initialization when no trackers have been initialized with
